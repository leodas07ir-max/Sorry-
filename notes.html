            <h1>Dear Aiendri,</h1>
            <div class="proposal-text">
                <p>Hi there, actually first of all ik I'm sorry maybe I'm late or im on time but sorry. Last year on this day me Mr Irin Saha had a high fever and shivering body made courage to confess my feelings to the girl i was having a crush on & and see me today nearly ok but a bit broke due to situations then also I was not able to encourage myself cz ig ik what would be results, but always thinking of results isn't right so....</p>
                
                <p>I won't force you any way to accept or reject me, its totally based on ur feelings like if u love me u accept and if u not u reject and break up again, hmm that still hurts a lot -like a every day chestpain increasing with time...</p>
                
                <p>I won't make any fake promises like I've seen many other boys or couples would make for each other but I would like to be the real. If i say that i love u then u should know that I won't joking or anything if I'm urs then it's for my whole life. I won't promise of bringing u moon or stars but to keep you happy feel secure and safe in any aspects or conditions of life, i won't hide any of the stuff within me whether of a overthinking or any doubt I would talk and clear it out, i won't ever anyhow lead you to shred tears cz of me but would destroy the ones who are the reason behind it..</p>
                
                <p>I won't say a lot but the time I spent with u isn't or wasn't a one to be broke or lose... I just want to stay or live with you grow old maybe sounds some kind of fantasy or physco but it's true - these feelings are and were true all throughout these year from last year to till now Not for a single moment I've stopped loving you nor i would stop...</p>
